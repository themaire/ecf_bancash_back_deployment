Included too :

## ActivitÃ© Type 1 : Automatisation du dÃ©ploiement dâ€™infrastructure dans le Cloud

2. Ajoutez/configurez les variables dâ€™environnement qui se connectent Ã  la BDD 
   (added in the service definition on the Terraform script)

## Introduction :
<p>Once our AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster is up (see how : [themaire/ecf_eks_terraform](https://github.com/themaire/ecf_eks_terraform/)) and the nodejs demo app is Dockerizez (see how : [themaire/ecf_eks_terraform](https://github.com/themaire/ecf_bancash_back/)), we can now deploy the app on the cluster.</p>

### What I done :

<p>
In the Terraform's main.tf I followed theses steps :

1. : Create a namespace<br><br>
Helped by kubernetes_namespace Terraform's ressource.<br><br>

2. : Deploy our Docker image<br><br>
The kubernetes_deployment Terraform's ressource describes here several important informations lile the size of replicas in pods, witch Docker image is used, the container's application port and various container's environments variable to provide a PostgreSQL database connexion as asked.<br><br>




3. : Declare a service<br><br>
Deployed application needs to be accessed outside the cluster from internet. The kubernetes_service Terraform's ressource describes the port number will the app be accessed from the internet.
VERY important : a load balancer is necessary to provide a url to the cluster.<br><br>


Make sÃ»r to have terraform and aws cli command line tools installed and configured on your machine. Then, you can use the Terraform's main.tf file by :

Usage :
```
terraform init
terraform plan # For prevew what will do
terraform apply
```

# Screenshots
The deployment is seen in the console. In the status, the two replicas are "ready".

As the deployment, service wanted is also seen in the console.

Load balancer for the cluster. Url marked in red for the access to the deployed app.

End of the Terraform's output. Deployment and service added with success.
Then, i tested the aivability of the app with a simple curl command line.

NestJS demo application on a Kubernetes cluster deployed on the cloud is working! Well done! ðŸ˜Ž
